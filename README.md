<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Northstar is born from a simple observation - **Terraform** is amazing but:

- It's not meant to be in the hot path of your users
- It is a tool used in your CI / Local machine

‚≠ê Northstar tries to address these issues by:

- Being API-driven.
- Being a horizontally scalable and multi-tenant system.
- Being a real distributed system ready to be in the hot path of consumers.

üåü On top of that, Northstar provides the usual features you would expect from an infrastructure orchestrator:

- Automated drift correction
- Composable infrastructure resources
- Multi-cloud
- Extensibility

‚ùå Northstar is not for you if:

- You are not willing to deploy a reasonably complex system
- You don't need API driven provisioning

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Follow these simple example steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

To run Northstar you will need to have Rust installed on your machine, you can then run:

    cargo build

To build the various libraries and binaries.

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos
work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.
